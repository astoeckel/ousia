# Ousía – Extensible Semantic Markup Language

Ousía _[ˈuːziə]_ represents documents in purely semantic markup with user definable structure.

Documents are parsed into an universal intermediate representation, ready to be converted to any format using XSLT.

_Warning:_ Ousía is a research project initially developed by Benjamin Paaßen and Andreas Stöckel. While the codebase is fully functional and in a quite mature state, we are currently evaluating a rewrite of most parts of the project as a result of the experience from using Ousía.
