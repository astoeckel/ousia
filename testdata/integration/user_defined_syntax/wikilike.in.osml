== This tests somewhat plays with user defined syntax ==

As you -- surely -- can see, just the tiny `\\syntax` definitions above make writing documents
much easier.

For instance, this is a new paragraph.

And here goes another one.

All with the power of just adding `\\close\{\\paragraph\}` to the `\\syntax`
definition of the paragraph structure.

<<Well, that's insane!>>, I hear you say. Right so! This indeed is insane.

== One last thing ==

Did you notice how we started sections here?

Sections can be allowed to use Wiki-like syntax with only three lines of code. Awesome!
