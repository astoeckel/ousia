% To Autumn by John Keats (1820)

\begin{poem}
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
	Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
	Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
	The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
		And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
	Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
	With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
	And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
		To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
	And still more, later flowers for the bees,
	Until they think warm days will never cease,
		For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
	Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
	Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
	Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
		Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
	Steady thy laden head across a brook;
	Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
		Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.

Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
	Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,â€”
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
	And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
\end{poem}
